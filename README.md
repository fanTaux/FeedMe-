## Background


### Problem Statements
1. Feeding and watering chickens is still performed manually, requiring the farmer's constant physical presence.
2. Farm management is inefficient in terms of time and energy due to repetitive daily tasks.
3. The temperature inside the chicken coop is unpredictable and not consistently monitored, which can negatively affect chicken health and growth.
   
### Goals
1. Automate the feeding and watering process with remote control and scheduling via a mobile app.
2. Improve time and energy efficiency for the farmer, allowing focus on other productive activities.
3. Enable real-time monitoring of the coop's temperature to maintain an ideal environment.

### Solution Statements
1. Build an IoT-based automatic feeding and watering system using actuators like servo motors and waterpump.
2. Develop a mobile application to serve as a control dashboard for scheduling, manual commands, and monitoring.
3. Integrate a temperature sensor (e.g., DHT11) to provide real-time environmental data on the mobile app.
4. Use an ESP32 microcontroller to control the entire system, including sensors, actuators, and Wi-Fi connectivity.
